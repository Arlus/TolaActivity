<!--         <b>INVEST </b>seeks to address the longer-term needs identified by IDPs by providing vocational training linked to economic opportunities within the locale, and by delivering life skills modules to further support graduates and aid repatriation to home provinces. The program will deliver market-specific vocational and life skills training to 7,500 vulnerable individuals in Kandahar, Afghanistan by 2017.
        <br/><br/>In 2011, UNHCR and the World Bank completed research on IDPs in Kabul, Kandahar and Herat cities interviewing 450 IDP households. UNHCR found that conflict-induced displacement, limited reintegration opportunities for returning refugees, the rapid growth of cities, and the proliferation of informal settlements constitute an enormously complex challenge for the government, municipalities, and humanitarian and development actors in Afghanistan. The study highlighted that displacement to urban centers is rarely temporary, at least partly due to livelihood opportunities; and that IDPs have fewer labor market opportunities than host community members. This is mainly due to the lack of skills adapted to the economic context and lower literacy rate, which translates into lower earning capacity and higher vulnerability to poverty.
        <br/><br/>International and national groups deliver humanitarian assistance, yet there is an acute demand for funding to shift towards economic recovery and direct livelihood opportunities for the returnee and IDP population. Afghan and international actors must go beyond a purely humanitarian approach and look for sustainable solutions for IDPs. Market-driven, short-term technical and life skills training linked to job placements – that support existing Afghan government interventions - can address this demand.
        <br/><br/>Since trainings began in the first year of INVEST-in-Kandahar, we have received numerous requests from various communities and government departments to offer technical vocational and educational (TVET) courses in their localities, further emphasizing the desire for more sustainable support. UNOCHA also highlighted the benefit of vocational training or educational support to displaced persons as a means of supporting sustainable reintegration and mitigating various protection risks. Building on the successful DFID-funded INVEST model in Helmand, the program conducted a detailed market assessment in Kandahar to identify key in-demand skills in the current marketplace, which has guided the selection of courses offered. -->

<!--     Mercy Corps has partnered with nearly 400 local business with the goal of employing INVEST participants in the fields they study. These partnerships are an integral part of INVEST’s success.
    <br/><br/>By connecting participants with local, skilled businesses, participants continue to gain skills while developing community. -->

    <h1 class="sidebar-header">How Do the VTCs Work?<span class="sidebar-close"><i class="fa fa-caret-left"></i></span></h1>
<!--     <b>Area of Focus - Kandahar City, Dand, Daman, Arghandab and Spin Boldack Districts</b><br/>
    The VTCs deliver short courses (3 months or 6 months, 2 hours x 6 days/week) for 7,500 students. Subjects are those for which skills were found to be in demand in the local market, and include mobile phone repair, plumbing, wiring, embroidery and tailoring. Mercy Corps has learned from its work in Helmand that students that have limited experience with a classroom setting prefer classes that are of short duration, practical and intensive. This furthermore recognizes the importance of providing education opportunities that are adaptive to the familial and financial obligations that constrain the majority of Afghan returnees. Graduates are linked to the market in part through their instructors who are themselves master craftsmen and successful business owners in their specific trade . In addition to vocational training, graduates have the opportunity to participate in Ready to Earn Clubs (RECs); these clubs are built on Mercy Corps’ experience which has led us to go beyond traditional livelihood programming, recognizing that young people need support beyond just technical skills to successfully enter the market and to be productive members of society.
    <br/><br/>Young people – particularly those growing up in a context of violent instability and uncertainty – also need access to opportunity, knowledge of how to make the most of that opportunity, and of what support exists for them in the local environment. The RECs represent a more holistic approach to the needs of the target population by providing support in business skills and basic financial management, in addition to transferable skills which have a demonstrated positive influence on employment and more explicit links to market actors. Importantly, RECs also offer a continued sense of community for INVEST participants, a supportive social environment in which graduates can come together to collaborate, support each other in their new ventures, and share experiences.
    <br/><br/>Student recruitment occurs in partnership with entities in Kandahar that register IDPs and returnees, the Department of Women’s Affairs and other NGO actors operating in Kandahar. In addition, Mercy Corps Pakistan’s programming in Quetta has been working on vocational training with Afghan Refugees for many years and acts as a cross-border referral system for Afghan refugees seeking to become returnees to their provinces of origin in Kandahar and Helmand.
    <br/><br/>INVEST is built upon community trust and mutual desire for sustainable solutions. Now that the value of the program has been clearly established, participants have started to pay fees for their training course. Different approaches are also being trialed to begin to pave the way for a fully cost recoverable training mechanism to be left behind once the donor funded program comes to an end. -->

<div class="sidebar-pane" id="demographic">
    <h1 class="sidebar-header">Who's INVEST's Target Demographic?<span class="sidebar-close"><i class="fa fa-caret-left"></i></span></h1>
<!--     The target population of INVEST-in-Kandahar is Afghan returnees and IDPs and vulnerable host community members ages 15 to 35 based in and around Kandahar City and the three neighboring districts of Dand, Daman, Arghandab and Spin Boldak. Kandahar province has a population of 1.1 million with a 7.3% average literacy rate for those over 16 years old, significantly lower than the national average of 25%. The female literacy rate is even lower at just 1.3% for Kandahar compared to the national average of 11.4%. Comprehensive official statistics on the number of complaints of violence against women in Afghanistan are not available according to UNHCR, but it is understood that gender based violence exists in Kandahar at relatively high rates but that most incidents are unreported.
    <br/><br/>Opportunities available to this demographic are very limited due to the political and economic instability in Southern Afghanistan. IDPs and returnees living in and around Kandahar City include unemployed men, women and children, few of whom have any formal education, or current access to school. Beneficiaries will be selected through referral of IDP and returnee serving organizations, local community leaders and provincial level stakeholders. Mercy Corps prioritizes: widows, illiterate and semi-literate returnees, heads of households without working dependents (prioritizing female headed households), unemployed or underemployed youth, migrants to urban Kandahar, and those that have been displaced. We also allocate at least 5% of class placements to people with disabilities.
    <br/><br/>INVEST-in-Kandahar supported TVET courses are delivered by local master craftsmen and are practical and pragmatic to accommodate literacy levels; participation in INVEST offers both formal qualifications and enhanced life skills. The scale of the program allows for a large numbers of trainees diluting issues such as nepotism, patronage and preferential status within the IDP and returnee communities. Students are recommended and sponsored by responsible and acknowledged leaders in the community who then support the students in their future endeavors. -->
